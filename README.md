Exporter for metrics from devices running JunOS (via SSH) https://prometheus.io/

## Remarks
This project is an alternative approach for collecting metrics from Juniper devices.
The set of metrics is minimal to increase performance.
We (a few friends from the Freifunk community and myself) used the generic snmp_exporter before.
Since snmp_exporter is highly generic it comes with a lot of complexity at the cost of performance.
We wanted to have an KIS and vendor specific exporter instead.
This approach should allow us to scrape our metrics in a very time efficient way.
For this reason this project was started.

## Important notice for users of version < 0.7
In version 0.7 a typo in the prefix of all BGP related metrics was fixed. Please update your queries accordingly.

## Important notice for users of version < 0.5
In version 0.5 SNMP was replaced by SSH. This is was a breaking change (metric names were kept).
All SNMP related parameters were removed at this point.
Please have a look on the new SSH related parameters and update your service units accordingly.

## Features
The following metrics are supported by now:
* Interfaces (bytes transmitted/received, errors, drops)
* Routes (per table, by protocol)
* Alarms (count)
* BGP (message count, prefix counts per peer, session state)
* OSPFv2, OSPFv3 (number of neighbors)
* Interface diagnostics (optical signals)
* ISIS (number of adjacencies, total number of routers)
* Environment (temperatures)
* Routing engine statistics
* Storage (total, available and used blocks, used percentage)
* Firewall filters (counters and policers) - needs explicit rights beyond read-only
* Statistics about l2circuits (tunnel state, number of tunnels)
```   0:EI -- encapsulation invalid      12:NP -- interface h/w not present
   1:MM -- mtu mismatch               13:Dn -- down
   2:EM -- encapsulation mismatch     14:VC-Dn -- Virtual circuit Down
   3:CM -- control-word mismatch      15:Up -- operational
   4:VM -- vlan id mismatch           16:CF -- Call admission control failure
   5:OL -- no outgoing label          17:IB -- TDM incompatible bitrate
   6:NC -- intf encaps not CCC/TCC    18:TM -- TDM misconfiguration
   7:BK -- Backup Connection          19:ST -- Standby Connection
   8:CB -- rcvd cell-bundle size bad  20:SP -- Static Pseudowire
   9:LD -- local site signaled down   21:RS -- remote site standby
  10:RD -- remote site signaled down  22:HS -- Hot-standby Connection
  11:XX -- unknown
```

## Install
```bash
go get -u github.com/czerwonk/junos_exporter
```

## Usage
In this example we want to scrape 3 hosts:
* Host 1 (DNS: host1.example.com, Port: 22)
* Host 2 (DNS: host2.example.com, Port: 2233)
* Host 3 (IP: 172.16.0.1, Port: 22)

### Binary
```bash
./junos_exporter -ssh.targets="host1.example.com,host2.example.com:2233,172.16.0.1" -ssh.keyfile=junos_exporter
```

### Docker
```bash
docker run -d --restart unless-stopped -p 9326:9326 -v /opt/junos_exporter_keyfile:/ssh-keyfile:ro -v /opt/junos_exporter_config.yml:/config.yml:ro czerwonk/junos_exporter
```

### Target Parameter
By default, all configured targets will be scrapped when `/metrics` is hit. As an alternative, it is possible to scrape a specific target by passing the target's hostname/IP address to the target parameter - e.g. ` http://localhost:9326/metrics?target=1.2.3.4`. The specific target must be present in the configuration file or passed in with the ssh.targets flag, otherwise, the request will be denied. This can be used with the below example Prometheus config:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'junos'
    static_configs:
      - targets:
        - 192.168.1.2  # Target device.
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__address__]
        target_label: __param_target
      - source_labels: [__param_target]
        target_label: instance
      - target_label: __address__
        replacement: 127.0.0.1:9326  # The junos_exporter's real hostname:port.
```

## Config file

The exporter can be configured with a YAML based config file:

```yaml
targets:
  - router1
  - router2

features:
  bgp: true
  ospf: false
  isis: false
  l2circuit: false
  environment: true
  routes: true
  routing_engine: true
  interface_diagnostic: true
  firewall: false
```
